Funded by the Western Economic Diversification Canada, 20-foot high concrete “Zhong” character symbolizes Chinese moderation and harmony. 
Six foot bronze figures sculpted in the round, has stood alone since it’s commemoration on Remembrance Day, November 11th, 2003.
Heroic stances of both WWII soldier and railway worker can be experienced from several angles and the monument carries the weight of Keefer Triangle, where Keefer and Columbia streets meet at the bottom section of a gentle slope where an air of emptiness hangs. 
Yet the monument stands in a crossroads, rather than a space “bounded” and intimate”, like that of the “urban square” where people can come together and find community.
