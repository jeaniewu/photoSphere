Shanghai alley is beside the Sam Kee building. During the year of 1890, Shanghai Alley was the home for over 1,000 Chinese Residents who worked, lived, and raised families in the alleys. 
Between 1890-1920 early chinese immigrants settled in Shanghai alley and Canton Alley in Vancouver Chinatown. 
A 500 seat theatre was built for activities and entertainment for the people in 1898. This is where the community events were held, and the community came together as a whole. 
There was no need to leave their neatly woven community when it came to entertainment, or even grocery shopping since they had access to their market right in town in each of the alley’s.
